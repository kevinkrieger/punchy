// Call this with one of the USIDIV_* constants as a usi_clock_divider parameter, which will set the clock divider used
// for USI I2C communications. The usi_clock_source parameter should be set to one of the USISSEL* constants. Example:

// Sends a command/data sequence that can include restarts, writes and reads. Every transmission begins with a START,
// and ends with a STOP so you do not have to specify that. Will busy-spin if another transmission is in progress. Note
// that this is interrupt-driven asynchronous code: you can't just call i2c_send_sequence from an interrupt handler and
// expect it to work: you risk a deadlock if another transaction is in progress and nothing will happen before the
// interrupt handler is done anyway. So the proper way to use this is in normal code. This should not be a problem, as
// performing such lengthy tasks as I2C communication inside an interrupt handler is a bad idea anyway.  wakeup_sr_bits
// should be a bit mask of bits to clear in the SR register when the transmission is completed (to exit LPM0: LPM0_BITS
// (CPUOFF), for LPM3: LPM3_bits (SCG1+SCG0+CPUOFF))
